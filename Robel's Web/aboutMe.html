          Originally from Eritrea (East Africa), I have lived in the UK for nearly a decade. A software development enthusiast, with
          a strong academic background and the analytical ability to think through a problem.
        </p>

        <p class="lead " style="text-align: justify">
          Whilst studying Computer Science at Kingston University, I enjoyed the challenge, particularly programming in various languages,
          which allowed me to constantly be creative and learn new concepts. I also hold a masters degree in Software Engineering,
          which was critical at furthering my practical and theoretical knowledge in the software eco-system.
        </p>

        <p class="lead " style="text-align: justify">
          Currently, I work for an IT firm (QA Consulting Ltd) and currently have been deployed as a full stack software developer at Santander
          Bank. I'm working with an agile team of IT professionals which deals with the online payments system. We develop
          Microservices and APIs that helps the bank to carry out its day-to-day activities efficiently.
        </p>

          I'm a big fan of cycling sport and I do cycle whenever I have the opportunity to do so. I also like traveling, as I'm curious
          to explore different culture and histories. And very recently, I have bought myself an acoustic guitar, and I'm
          inteding to teach myself to playing it.
